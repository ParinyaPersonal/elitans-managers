# Elitans Managers
Hello, this is a tool for minecraft bedrock edition. It helps to manage your add-ons and it will be very convenient, I am glad that you will use it, I hope that it will be useful to you.

## Setup your system
Okay, so the first step is to install something called node js. You can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you have already installed a clone or downloaded this repositoris file, then run the file named start.cmd. It will install the package. When finished you will find that link http://localhost:8888 Once you enter this link you will be successful. And it won't install again. If you've installed it before, you can use this cmd file to start again.

P.S. In conclusion, you must have an api key in order to use it as usual, hahaha.
